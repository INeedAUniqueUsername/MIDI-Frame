# MidiVisualizer
This is a very basic MIDI visualizer that reads in a MIDI file and generates video frames by modifying a template image based on which keys are pressed on each moment.

# Demo
Here is the first and only video I've ever made with this program. Producing the visual took WAY too much time as I had to get it to sync up with the video and running the program + rendering the images into video went extremely slowly each time.

# What I learned
"Ai no Uta" from Pikmin is a great song - maybe one of the best I've ever heard.
