# MIDI-Frame
This is a very basic MIDI visualizer that reads in a MIDI file and generates video frames by modifying a template image based on which keys are pressed on each moment.

# Demo
Here is the first and only video I've ever made with this program. Producing the visual took WAY too much time as I had to get it to sync up with the video and writing/running/testing/fixing the program + rendering the frames into video went extremely slowly per every iteration.

# What I learned
"Ai no Uta" from Pikmin is a great song - maybe one of the best I've ever heard. It's the kind of song that can make you want to study piano seriously just so you can play it well.
